Ok, that's the main credits over now read the important bits:-

ABOUT THE DEMO
==============

You can run this demo on most Amiga systems, but if you only have 
500k the music will only play for a short time and you miss out
on the background for the hotdog demo.

The demo is semi-interactive so if you follow the on-screen 
instructions you will be able to play with some of the BIG (and
I mean BIG!) BOB`s that appear.

If you press <CONTROL> + <C> during the demo you will stop the
program running. This will give you the opportunity to see how the
editor works. You can jump to the editor by pressing <ESC> - this
is also how you can jump to direct mode.

Direct Mode allows you to play with any of the commands you can
see in the demo listing, LOAD IFF, BOB, SPRITE, MUSIC and load`s
of others - please feel free to experiment and have fun.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS
=================
The AMOS system has been created by Francois Lionet, the genius
behind the best-selling Atari ST package STOS.
The demo was masterminded by Richard Vanner and Chris Payne and 
was implimented by me (Peter Hickman) who now knows AMOS better 
than just about anybody!!! (Sorry about the terrible grammar but
it`s my demo so I`m allowed to give myself plugs like that!!!)
The really great music was composed and written by Allister 
Brimble using the Game Music Creator (GMC).
If anybody out there would like some music composed for some
commercial software contact Richard Vanner at Mandarin Software
and he will put you in touch with Allister.
I am a journalist and enjoy writing educational software, so if
anybody wants to Start an AMOS column or needs some educational 
software converting get in touch with me (through Mandarin) or
you can find my address in New Atari User magazine (at the end 
of my STOS column!).

ABOUT AMOS
==========
AMOS is nearly complete, with only the very basic routines 
waiting to be implimented. The menu system used by AMOS is 
mind blowing, it is very similar to the Apple Macintosh only
better. Up to eight sub-menus can be nested under any single
menu option giving access to VERY large numbers of menus.
Some other fab commands are those that alter the contents of 
the COPPER chip - this allows anybody to create those wavy
multicoloured demo's that seems to be popular on the Amiga.
The disk commands are all built into AMOS so you don't have to 
open any external libraries (as in some other langauges), the
same goes for file selectors and window functions, they are all
very fast and very easy to use.
Screen copying is achieved by directly accessing the Blitter
so it is fast enough to draw a block on a screen in real time 
with the mouse (ie much faster than deluxe paint III).
AMOS allows ANY type of IFF screen to be loaded (as long as you 
have enough memory), it does this with a super fast routine so 
there is only a small delay during loading.
BOB's and SPRITE's can be created with the sprite editor or
they can be cut out of any screen, their size is limited only
by the amount of free memory, of course once cut out the
BOB's/SPRITE's can then be saved using a single command.
 
MORE ABOUT AMOS
===============
AMOS will be released in May at a retail price of forty nine
pounds and ninty five pence (I cannot get this stupid word
processor to do a pound sign!!). It will include the basic
interpretor, a really thick manual detailing every command in 
incredible detail (which is being written by best selling 
technical author Stephen Hill), a set of example games written
by Francois Lionet, Me, Aaron and Adam Fothergill and Stephen
Hill, A load of really useful accessories that can be resident 
along with any of your own programs, an advanced sprite editor,
an advanced music editor, another big manual detailing the
accessories. AMOS will also include lots of little demos
showing you how to get the most out of it. This big demo will
be chopped up and annotated to a very high degree so that each 
section will be very easy to understand and lots of new bits
will be added so that anyone will be able to amaze people 
with the things that only AMOS makes possible.

SUGGESTIONS
===========
If there is a particular accessory or game you would like to
see in AMOS please write or phone Mandarin, they would love to 
here from you and will pass your suggestions onto Francois 
Lionet and the rest of the development team.

I look forward to hearing from you, have fun with the demo.

P.S. If there are any spelling mistakes or bugs in this demo
I will apologise now, I am afraid that even though AMOS is
really fantastic it cannot stop my brain from breaking down
after a hard night of programming.

P.P.S. Francois is going to hate me for saying this but AMOS
really is brill, in my ten years of computing it has to be
the best (and most user friendly) language I have ever used.
Please pass this demo onto your friends so they can see the
power that AMOS gives to the ordinary Amiga user.
