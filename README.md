## The Amos demo disc

In 1990, prior to the launch of [**AMOS Basic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOS_(programming_language)) on the Amiga computer, a series of ads were published in the UK press (including the issue 06 of Amiga Format, page 69).

One of these ads was a coupon to be sent to **Mandarin Software** in exchange of a preview & demo disc of the Amos Basic. On the disc was a technical demo of both the Amiga computer and the AMOS Basic capabilities, demonstrating scrolling, sprites, bobs and soundtracker music. The demo was written by **Peter Hickman**, the music composed by **Allister Brimble** (also known for his huge contribution to the video game culture).

This is a *reimplementation* of this demo, in Python 3 using the graphic framework [HARFANG 3D](http://www.harfang3d.com).
